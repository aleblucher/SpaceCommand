# SpaceCommand
My first Unity game. Any similarities to an already existing one are coincidental.


# Features added
1. Player has three lives and disappears when they are over.
2. Life is displayed as the cute hearts on the top left of the screen.
3. Alien makes the static base disappear if it touches it.
4. The fewer Aliens there are, the faster they are.
5. The fewer Aliens there are, the more frequently they shoot.
6. Speed was calculated for a balanced game experience.
7. Shots from both parties are blocked by the bases.
(8.) A lot of love from a newbie game dev was put into this very simple game :)
